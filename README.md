# JASM
JASM (Just Another Smart Mirror) is a mirror with built in voice commands. The original project that was built for MangoHacks had more features than the version that is currently available. 


## Current Features

* "Jas, Chill" which opens netflix and plays "Careless Whispers" by George Michaels
* "Jas, Mixtape" which opens up my this website
* "Jas, Help" which opens up the options menu
* "Jas, Home" which hides the options menu.

## Original Features:

* Displays Current Weather. Using Simple WeatherJS and HTML5's GeoLocation
* Voice Command "Jas, map of (City/State/Country)". Using the Google Maps API
* RSS feed from CNN

The mirror was actually a 16" x 17" 2 way piece of acrylic with a 19" monitor behind it running our webapp that was hosted off a raspberry pi apache server. The original webapp was very crude and not responsive to different screen sizes so I have started to remake it using bootstrap and the knowledge I've gained since first making that project
